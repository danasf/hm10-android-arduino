# HM-10 App Test

### About

This is my first attempt to connect Android, Bluetooth LE/4.0, Arduino and a WS2812 LED strip. It's designed for use with inexpensive HM-10 BLE/BT 4.0 modules based upon TI's CC2540.

Blue Light app is derived from Google's sample code:

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html

Contributions and improvements are very welcome, Android development is quite new for me.

Most of this is at a proof of concept stage but I hope to develop it further!

If you would like to install the APK, it's here:

Tested on Nexus 4, Android 4.4.2
